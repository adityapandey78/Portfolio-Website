This is the Portfolio Website using HTML and CSS.
This helped me to get the better grasp of following functionalities of CSS:
            a.) Flebox and Grid
            b.) Animation Properties
            c.) Alignment and color adnd background properties and most important position properties.
I am still workinging on this project and need final touch-ups.
I have to add the footer.

Here is the live link for the project ðŸ”— https://portfoliowebsitepaddy.netlify.app/
